## Values and vision

My values are centred on sustainable development so that my children, my family, my community and the broader society (including our global civilisation) may survive and thrive in a rapidly evolving environmental crisis, in the context of entrenched disparities in socio-economic determinants of health. Solutions for climate change AND poverty et cetera are urgently needed.

I subscribe to the definition: Health is a Sustainable State of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. (WHO Constitution 1948 and I especially acknowledge the contribution of the proposed additional words Sustainable State by [Maurice King, 1990, The Lancet](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1975859/)).

My vision is to quantify health impacts of environmental risks, adjusted for social factors, and communicate evidence for decision making for mitigation of, and adaptation to changing environments and socio-economic systems.
