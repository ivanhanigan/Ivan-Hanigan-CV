title: Values and vision
---


My values are centred on sustainable development so that my children, my community and the broader society (including our global civilisation) may survive and thrive in a rapidly evolving environmental crisis.

My vision is to quantify health impacts of environmental risks and communicate evidence for decision making for mitigation of, and adaptation to changing environments and socio-economic systems.
