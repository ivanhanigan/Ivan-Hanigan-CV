1. My work on the 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfire smoke impact on mortality was highlighted in a Sydney Morning Herald opinion piece advocating for a more nuanced approach to managing smoke exposure from the recent hazard reduction burns there. September 2023. https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/it-s-time-to-stop-sydneysiders-sharing-one-gigantic-ciggie-20230915-p5e4zd.html
1. I published one of the first studies projecting future impacts of drought on suicide and was also able to publish a piece calling for more conversation about mitigation not just adaptation for the conversation https://theconversation.com/drought-increases-rural-suicide-and-climate-change-will-make-drought-worse-185392 
1. I published one of the first studies globally of observed climate change health impacts (https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13107). To support this important finding I contributed an article in The Conversation for the general public: https://theconversation.com/more-people-die-in-winter-than-summer-but-climate-change-may-see-this-reverse-159135.
1. In the bushfire crisis of 2019/2020 I was able to provide comments to five articles in the media. 
1. I submitted an opinion piece to the Canberra Times which was published: http://www.canberratimes.com.au/comment/how-maps-can-lie-hiding-disease-in-our-suburbs-20170810-gxtano.html.  This article was a product of the UC Early Career Researcher Development program, module 2 ‘Getting your story published’. A media report for Friday 18 August 2017 indicated at least 119 copies of the article had been published by Fairfax Media. The potential audience reach of the University media coverage during this time was approximately 16 million. (Source: Meltwater)
