## Teaching and supervision

I am a Teaching and Research Academic committed to facilitating an enriching learning environment, closely connected to a vibrant research and engagement program that links education, research, policy and action in public health. I continually reflect on my teaching practices and impact on students, peers and broader community. In 2022 I was recruited to become Senior Lecturer in Climate Change and Health at the Curtin School of Population Health, where I was entrusted to create the first undergraduate unit on Climate Change and Health Impact Assessment (HIA) to be taught in Australia. I was also tasked with updating the postgraduate HIA unit to reflect this rapidly evolving field. 

### Teaching

I am Unit Coordinator for the following School of Population Health Units:

-	PUBH3007 Climate Change, Health and Big Data, third year. The capstone in Health Science Data Specialisation Stream of the bachelor Health Science. Mean numbers enrolled since inception = 9.3.
-	ENHL6000 Health Impact Assessment. This is a postgraduate unit accredited under Australia Environmental Health University Program Accreditation Framework (EHUPAF) which provides the foundation for the education of Environmental Health Officers (EHOs). Numbers enrolled = 77.
-	OCHS5003 (and linked Open University Australia OCHS5010) Risk Management and Safety Technology. A Postgraduate unit in accredited in Australia and the United Kingdom by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health. Numbers enrolled = 50.


### Postdoctoral research fellows

-	Dr Lucas Hertzog. I recruited Dr Hertzog after an international search with many applicants. I assisted Lucas to make the transition from sociology to eco-social epidemiology and after working for a year with him I mentor him as a future leader in the NHMRC HEAL national network. I also mentor Lucas in terms of his academic and career progression
