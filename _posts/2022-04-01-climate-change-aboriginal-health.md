Groups who experience social and economic inequity including Aboriginal1 peoples will be
disproportionately affect by climate change. More Aboriginal peoples live in NSW than in any other
Australian state or territory and improving Aboriginal health is a primary focus for the NSW health
system. Understanding the impact of climate on the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal peoples is key to
the development of adaptation strategies and responses to reduce these impacts under the influence of
a changing climate.

Recent years have seen growing recognition that understanding resilience processes requires examining the cumulative effects or impacts of exposure to multiple simultaneous stressors.
