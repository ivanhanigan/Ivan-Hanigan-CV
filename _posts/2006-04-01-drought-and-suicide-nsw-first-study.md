Nicholls, N., Butler, C. D., & Hanigan, I. (2006). Inter-annual rainfall variations and suicide in New South Wales, Australia, 1964-2001. International Journal of Biometeorology, 50(3), 139â€“143. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-005-0002-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-005-0002-y)

This was the first study in the world to analyse the association between drought (measured as annual rainfall defecit) and suicide between 1964-2001. Drier years were associated with increased suicide rates, but we were unable to stratify by age, sex or rural/remote regions.
