My previous research on drought and health include the following:

 

1. Hanigan, I.C., Butler, C.D., Kokic, P.N. and Hutchinson, M.F. (2012). Suicide and drought in New South Wales, Australia, 1970-2007. PNAS http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1073/pnas.1112965109

Hutchinson's Drought Index used between 1970-2007 and suicide by age, sex and region. Drought was associated with increased suicide risk in rural men, but decreased risk in rural women.

 

2. Hanigan, I. C., Schirmer, J., & Niyonsenga, T. (2018). Drought and Distress in Southeastern Australia. EcoHealth. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-018-1339-0

Hutchinson's index used in a cross-sectional New finding of association in younger women. Coherence regarding previous lack of association in older women. No association in men. This pattern did not differ by farming status.

Future impacts estimated under various climate change scenarios. We wrote up advocacy too: https://theconversation.com/drought-increases-rural-suicide-and-climate-change-will-make-drought-worse-185392

4. Nicholls, N., Butler, C. D., & Hanigan, I. (2006). Inter-annual rainfall variations and suicide in New South Wales, Australia, 1964-2001. International Journal of Biometeorology, 50(3), 139–143. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-005-0002-y

Annual rainfall and suicide between 1964-2001. Drier years were associated with increased suicide rates, but we were unable to stratify by age, sex or rural/remote regions.

 

5. Powers, J. R., Dobson, A. J., Berry, H. L., Graves, A. M., Hanigan, I. C., and Loxton, D. (2015). Lack of association between drought and mental health in a cohort of 45-61 year old rural Australian women. ANZJPH. http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1111/1753-6405.12369

Hutchinson's index used at each survey follow up time in longitudinal study of women's health. Drought was NOT associated with depression in these older women.

 

6. O'Brien, L. V., Berry, H. L., Coleman, C., and Hanigan, I. C. (2014). Drought as a mental health exposure. Environmental Research,  http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.envres.2014.03.014

Variations of Hutchinson's index to capture lagged effects, or double/triple whammy effects of cycling in and out of drought. Drought was associated with distress in rural but not urban people.

Beggs, P.J., Zhang, Y., McGushin, A., Trueck, S., Linnenluecke, M.K., Bambrick, H., Capon, A.G., Vardoulakis, S., Green, D., Malik, A., Jay, O., Heenan, M., Hanigan, I.C., Friel, S., Stevenson, M., Johnston, F.H., McMichael, C., Charlson, F., Woodward, A.J. and Romanello, M.B.

I calculated the exposure to Droughts and Floods indicator using the SPEI.

 

 

I have also published supporting data and code for these studies.
