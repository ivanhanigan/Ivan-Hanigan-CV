Meeting with Simone Felton and David A. Fleming Munoz from CSIRO

I was invited to give insights regarding social impacts of drought indicators

### Background:

The discussion would be an interview for the CSIRO research project Drought Socio-Economic and Health Impacts Data and Indicators Review. Th=
is project is being undertaken for the federal Department of Agriculture an=
d we hope to have a discussion centred around the impacts of drought, parti=
cularly changes in health, and how these changes can be identified through =
data. You can confirm participation by reply email. Further information is =
attached and key points are below.



More about the research

The project=92s primary aim is to identify potentially relevant socio-econo=
mic and health indicators related to monitoring drought impacts beyond the =
farm gate. The research places particular focus on finding what potential d=
ata and indicators would be useful in an 'early warning=92 system. As part =
of this research, we are conducting a series of interviews to gain insights=
 into what the concept of early warning would mean from the perspecti=
ve of socio-economic and health drought impacts. To give you more backgroun=
d on the project and the interviews, I am attaching the participant informa=
tion sheet. Also, below is a short summary about the interview format.



Key points about the interview

The interview will be held online.

Information from the interview will be aggregated and reported in summary f=
orm.

Participants will remain anonymous in the report.

We plan to record this interview for the purpose of note taking and hold th=
is recording on a secure CSIRO server. You will be given an opportunity at =
the beginning of our discussion to request the interview not to be recorded=
.

The interview will take approximately 45 minutes.

We welcome one or two other relevant persons from your organisation to part=
icipate in this discussion if you want to invite them. Please ensure they r=
eceive the Participant Information Sheet before joining the discussion.

One or two CSIRO project members will be on the line during the discussion.

The research project is funded by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries =
and Forestry (DAFF) and carried out by the CSIRO


### Why was I invited



My previous research on drought and health include the following:



1. Hanigan, I.C., Butler, C.D., Kokic, P.N. and Hutchinson, M.F. (2012). Su=
icide and drought in New South Wales, Australia, 1970-2007. PNAS http://dx.=
doi.org/doi:10.1073/pnas.1112965109

Hutchinson's Drought Index used between 1970-2007 and suicide by age, sex a=
nd region. Drought was associated with increased suicide risk in rural men,=
 but decreased risk in rural women.

ess in Southeastern Australia. EcoHealth. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-01=
8-1339-0

Hutchinson's index used in a cross-sectional New finding of association in =
younger women. Coherence regarding previous lack of association in older wo=
men. No association in men. This pattern did not differ by farming status.

onal Journal of Biometeorology, 50(3), 139=96143. https://doi.org/10.1007/s=
00484-005-0002-y

Annual rainfall and suicide between 1964-2001. Drier years were associated =
with increased suicide rates, but we were unable to stratify by age, sex or=
 rural/remote regions.

., and Loxton, D. (2015). Lack of association between drought and mental he=
alth in a cohort of 45-61 year old rural Australian women. ANZJPH. http://d=
x.doi.org/doi:10.1111/1753-6405.12369

Hutchinson's index used at each survey follow up time in longitudinal study=
 of women's health. Drought was NOT associated with depression in these old=
er women.

Variations of Hutchinson's index to capture lagged effects, or double/tripl=
e whammy effects of cycling in and out of drought. Drought was associated w=
ith distress in rural but not urban people.

I calculated the exposure to Droughts and Floods indicator using the SPEI.





I have also published supporting data and code for these studies.
