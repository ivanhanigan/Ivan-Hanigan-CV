- 2017-2023 I coordinate the Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research (CAR) Exposure Assessment subcommittee, as well as the technical working group on exposure science.
- 2014-2015 I sat on the Information Infrastructure Data Delivery Group committee of the NCRIS funded Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN).  This committee coordinated the many multi-million dollar TERN Facilities with the primary purpose to provide a forum to develop a consistent approach for delivery of the information infrastructure.
